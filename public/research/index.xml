      <description>Longitudinal multimodal sensor data is often noisy, small and sparse. In order to address this problem we are proposing a ML ranking framework that tries to optimize predictions from the limited quantity of data available.
The framework
 enables processing of various combinations of sensor fusions, uses generalized and personalized modeling approaches with appropriate cross validation strategies, and builds a tensor-based aggregation and ranking strategy for final interpretation.  </description>

      <title>Predicting Depression in Adolescents through Passive Sensing: </title>

      <description>Depression in adults has been well explored in the area of passive sensing. However, there have been no study that solely focused on adolescents. According to National survey on drug use and health, 4.1 million U.S. adolescents have suffered from at least one major depressive episode. Only 32.3% adolescents received some form of specialize or non-specialized treatment. To address this gap we are studying how we can harness the predictive capabilities of passive sensors such as mobile phones and fitness trackers to predict depression in adolescents.</description>
