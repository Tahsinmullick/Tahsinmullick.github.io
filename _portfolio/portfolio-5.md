[🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Tahsinmullick/energy_consumption_forecast_and_causal_modeling)

Developed forecasting engine using XGBoost, RF, Transformers, and Prophet to model consumption patterns for power companies.

Applied DoWhy for causal inference, revealing feature–consumption relationships to guide capacity planning.

Delivered end-to-end CRISP-DM pipeline translating raw time-series data into actionable predictions.

Why this is attractive to Netflix: Shows strong forecasting, causal ML, and modeling capabilities applicable to personalization, demand prediction, and content optimization.
