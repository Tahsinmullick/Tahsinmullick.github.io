Evaluated zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompt strategies for dialogue summarization using FLAN-T5.

Found one-shot learning consistently outperformed other prompting formats for lightweight models—highlighting practical efficiency–performance tradeoffs.

Conducted targeted experiments to emulate evaluation standards similar to OpenAI’s prompt research workflows.
