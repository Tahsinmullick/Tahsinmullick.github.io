Implemented self-attention, masked attention, and multi-head attention from scratch to demystify the mathematical core of transformer architectures.

Built a functional encoder–decoder pipeline following Attention Is All You Need to strengthen low-level understanding important for alignment and safety research.

Designed clean, interpretable code to help expose matrix operations at each computation step.
