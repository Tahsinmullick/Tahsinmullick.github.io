# About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Tahsin Uddin Mullick, Ph.D. — a researcher, data scientist, and educator driven by the belief that AI should empower people.

🎓 I earned my Ph.D. in Systems & Information Engineering from the University of Virginia, specializing in human-centered computing, machine learning, deep learning, and multimodal behavioral modeling. My research spans mental health, robotics, and smart systems, with contributions supported by NIH, DARPA, and industry collaborations. Along the way, I’ve authored peer-reviewed publications, delivered conference talks, and hold a U.S. patent for intelligent systems design.

📊 As a Researcher/Data Scientist, I’ve applied ML and data-driven methods in healthcare, mobility, and manufacturing, streamlining workflows and uncovering actionable insights.

👨‍💻 As an educator, I’ve served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant across courses in Deep Learning, Data Science, Applied Mathematics, and Robotics, where I discovered the joy of making complex ideas accessible and inspiring students to see the bigger picture of AI. Mentoring students on projects that turned into real-world applications and publications is one of the most rewarding parts of my journey.

🌍 Whether it’s research, data science, or teaching, my passion is the same: using AI to unlock understanding, create impact, and share knowledge.
